## 2024-05-23 - Restricted Patient Data Exposure
**Vulnerability:** The PDS client was retrieving and returning full demographic details for patients flagged as "Restricted" (security code 'R') in the NHS PDS response. While the code identified the flag, it did not block access.
**Learning:** Checking for a security flag is insufficient if it doesn't interrupt the data flow. The original implementation parsed the flag but continued processing, relying on downstream consumers (which didn't exist) to handle it.
**Prevention:** Implement "fail-secure" logic at the data access layer. If a record is restricted, raise a specific exception immediately rather than returning the data object with a flag.
